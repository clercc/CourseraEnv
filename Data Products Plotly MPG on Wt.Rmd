## MPG vs Weight
####How do Miles per Gallon change when accounting for car weight when transmission type color and horsepower size are depicted?
```{r, echo = FALSE, message= FALSE, comment='', warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
df <- mtcars

df$am <- as.factor(df$am)
plot_ly(data = df, x = ~mpg, color = ~am, size = ~hp, y = ~wt, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers')
```
